=More Complex Searching with Compass=

== Code Location ==
This project is on a branch called weblogs see: http://code.google.com/p/pagingappfuse/source/browse/branches/weblogs/

See http://code.google.com/p/pagingappfuse/source/checkout for how to check it out

=== Overview ===
Using Appfuse ( http://www.appfuse.org ) and Compass ( http://www.compass-project.org/ ) to build a persistent model that is searchable.
Here is  a slightly more complex example of using Compass with Hibernate; with relationships between 3
entities and enabled searchable references across them.

This is a POJO model roughly based on Matt Raibles page at:
http://raibledesigns.com/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=HibernateRelationships

I have just updated it with Annotations etc. (which I can never remember so I 
used http://tadtech.blogspot.com/2007_09_01_archive.html as a quick reference guide)

== Running Steps ==
  # run it with 
  ## 	mvn jetty:run-war -Dmaven.test.skip=true
  ## 	(it is currently assuming an Apache Derby database on localhost)
  # login (admin/admin)
  # navigate to Admin menu then re-Index (we must rebuild the index for new searchable properties)
  # On menu click weblogs
  # search for the query term:  * sp`*` *
  # Hopefully you can see, (screenshot attached), examples on the results screen of:
  ## Clickable HREF links to the Authority Detail page for any ID's associated with an Authority search result - this will go off to the database and retrieve the Authority you want by its ID
  ## Second column of search results is a toString() on the search result object - you can see
that the search engine has returned a complete object, ready for use no need to go off to the 
database to retrieve it.

== Code Pointers ==
Have a look at the model POJO for Category, Weblog, Entry and see the Many-To-One Hibernate
mappings and the way Compass annotations enable you to do @SearchableRef - this enables you
to navigate to component objects of your search result object if you wish.
